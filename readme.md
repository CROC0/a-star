<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This assumes you have python3 and pip installed.

You may wish to use a virtual environment. This example does not and installs modules directly.

### install packages

```sh
pip install
```

### run application

```sh
python app.py
```

## Application Use

The application uses pygame to create a GUI to show my implementation of the A\* path finding algorithm.

To use:

- First click will set starting point (orange)
- second click will set the end point (blue)
- subsequent clicks will set barriers (black)

- push space bar to start algorith.

- c key will clear the board.
